  - Currently: Basic assignment support
  - Needed: Complex arithmetic, function calls

- [ ] **Constant definitions**
  - Currently: Not supported
  - Needed: `const` declarations

- [ ] **Type casting and conversions**
  - Currently: Not supported
  - Needed: Type conversion formatting

## üéØ Low Priority Features

### Reset and Initialization
- [x] **Reset statements**  
  - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: `reset q;`, `reset q[0];` formatting
  - Supports proper spacing and qubit indexing

### Advanced Language Constructs
- [ ] **extern function declarations**

  - Needed: External function interface formatting

- [ ] **pragma statements**  
  - Currently: Not supported
  - Needed: Compiler directive formatting

- [ ] **switch/case statements**
  - Currently: Not supported
  - Needed: Switch statement formatting

### Enhanced Comment Support
- [x] **Comment preservation and positioning**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**: Infrastructure added, limited by lexer grammar
  - Current limitation: Comments are skipped in lexer, requires grammar modification

- [ ] **Multi-line comment formatting**
  - Currently: Limited support
  - Needed: `/* */` block comment formatting

### Error Handling and Diagnostics
- [ ] **Better error messages**
  - Currently: Basic parse errors
  - Needed: Detailed syntax error reporting with line numbers

  - Introduce configurable formatting styles (e.g., indentation size, brace style, maximum line length) to align with various coding standards and personal preferences
  - Provide options to enable/disable specific formatting rules

- [ ] **Integration with Build Systems and IDEs:**
  - VS Code extension for qasmfmt
  - Pre-commit hook templates
  - Better integration with quantum development tools
